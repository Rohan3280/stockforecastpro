Here is the explaination of the algorithm in simple terms:

We're using historical data about stock prices to make predictions about future prices. We focus on two things: 
1. The difference between the opening and closing prices of a stock for a day.
2. The difference between the highest and lowest prices during that day.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1.>> Data Preparation: We organize the historical data into a table and calculate the differences mentioned above.

2.>> Splitting Data: We divide our data into two parts: training data and testing data. Training data is used to teach the algorithm, and testing data is used to see how well it learned.

3.>> Classification Model: We use a method called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict whether the stock price will go up or down tomorrow. This method looks at similar patterns in the past and makes a guess based on what happened after those patterns.

4.>> Regression Model: We use KNN again, but this time to predict exactly how much the stock price might change tomorrow.

5.>> Testing the Model: We test our models using the testing data to see how accurate our predictions are.

Overall, the algorithm helps investors make decisions about buying or selling stocks based on historical patterns and predictions about future stock movements.
